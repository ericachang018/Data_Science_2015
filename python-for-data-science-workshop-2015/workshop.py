######### Loops! They are awesome ########

 # homework - do 10 of these problems https://projecteuler.net/archives 

# numbers = [1,2 3, 7, 9, 10 ]

# odds = []

# for dog in numbers: 
# 	if % 2 == 1: 
# 		odds.append(dog)

# print odds 

#Construct a list of numbers between 0 and 1000 that are divisible by 33

# numbers = range(1000)
# div_by_33 = []

# for i in numbers:
# 	if i % 33 == 0:
# 		div_by_33.append(i)
# print div_by_33

#loop 2 exercise comptute the sum of numbers btw 0 - 10000 that 
# are even of divisable by 5

# numbers = range(10000)
# divisable = []

# for i in numbers: 
# 	if i % 2 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
# 		divisable.append(i)


# total = sum(divisable)	
# print total

# #or you can do 
# sum_of_loop = 0 
# for x in range(1000):
# 	if i % 2 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
# 		sum_of_loop += i 

# # list comp

# resutls = [i for i in range(10000) if i % 2 == 0 or i % 5 == 0 ]

# max(i for i in range (10000) if i % 2 == 0 or i % 5 == 0  )
