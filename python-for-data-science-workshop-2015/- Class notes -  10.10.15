look things up 
add things 
remove things
* use square brackets to access and reassign in dictionary. 
* use del to delete something out of a dictionary ex del x['Steve']
* something in x -- will only check keys 

dictionary specific function values and keys
* x.items() makes it into a list 



Create a dictionary called `class_data` with the following keys:
- "course_name", which should correspond to "Intro to Python"
- "student_count", which should correspond to number of students, say 20
- "instructor", which should itself be a dictionary with the following keys
    - "name" ("Suneel")
    - "gender" ("M")
    - "can_program" (True)
- get the student count from the dictionary
- get the instructor name from the dictionary
